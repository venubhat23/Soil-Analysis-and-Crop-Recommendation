# SOIL ANALYSIS AND CROP RECOMMENDATION

Tech Stack: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Machine Learning, MySQL
Developed an advanced system that integrates machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance crop yield through precise cultivation recommendations. Leveraged the Random Forest algorithm to analyze comprehensive soil datasets, including pH, moisture content, and nutrient levels, for early crop prediction. Employed the MobileNetv2 deep learning framework to classify soil types based on visual data from soil images. This innovative approach provided farmers with data-driven insights for optimal crop selection and resource optimization, effectively combining precision farming with sophisticated machine learning models for informed decision-making.
